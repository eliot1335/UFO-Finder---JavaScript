# UFO Finder - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

This is a JavaScript project which I will be creating a script to populate a table from its data source to the given html template, and create a trigger that would react to the input and alter the table display.


## Automatic Table and Date Search


- Create a basic HTML web page or use the index.html file provided.


- Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

Make sure you have a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.



- Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
